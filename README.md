# Research the Multidimensional Logistic Function  in the Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning
The paper presents the results of the research the model for changing the logistic function. The research was conducted on datasets generated based on the source code abc, cheeba, december_3, stasi, otario, dm, v-sign, tequila, flip malware source code base. Research was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the developed intrusion detection system with machine learning. As a mathematical apparatus for the research, a multidimensional logistic function softmax was chosen. The simulation of the developed software at different iterations and visualization of the results was carried out.
